# Social Network API

## Description

This Social Network API allows the user to manage and control a database of users, their thoughts, and reactions to their thoughts. It heavily utilizes Mongoose, a mongoDB framework, and express.js for routing.

## Usage

Using a testing API such as Insomnia or Postman, you should be able to reference the repository to see which routes are valid.

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` and `npm start` to get the server up and running. From there, you should be able to access the routes using a testing API.
